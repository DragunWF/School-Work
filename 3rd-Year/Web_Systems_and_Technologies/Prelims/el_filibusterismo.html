    <h1>El Filibusterismo</h1>
    <p>
      The death of Capitan Tiago and Basilio’s imprisonment were soon reported
      in the province, and to the honor of the simple inhabitants of San Diego,
      let it be recorded that the latter was the incident more regretted and
      almost the only one discussed. As was to be expected, the report took on
      different forms, sad and startling details were given, what could not be
      understood was explained, the gaps being filled by conjectures, which soon
      passed for accomplished facts, and the phantoms thus created terrified
      their own creators.

      In the town of Tiani it was reported that at least, at the very least, the
      young man was going to be deported and would very probably be murdered on
      the journey. The timorous and pessimistic were not satisfied with this but
      even talked about executions and courts-martial—January was a fatal month;
      in January the Cavite affair had occurred, and they1even though curates,
      had been garroted, so a poor Basilio without protectors or friends—

      “I told him so!” sighed the Justice of the Peace, as if he had at some
      time advised Basilio. “I told him so.”

      “It was to be expected,” commented Sister Penchang. “He would go into the
      church, and when he saw that the holy water was somewhat dirty, he
      wouldn’t cross himself with it. He talked about germs and disease, abá,
      it’s the chastisement of God! He deserved it, and he got it! As though the
      holy water could transmit diseases! Quite the contrary, abá!”
